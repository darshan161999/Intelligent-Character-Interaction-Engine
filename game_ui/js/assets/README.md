This directory should contain the following game assets:

## Tilesets
- `avengers_tileset.png` - Base tiles for ground, paths, and general terrain
- `avengers_buildings.png` - Building tiles and structures
- `avengers_objects.png` - Decorative objects, furniture, and items

- `captain_sprite.png` - Captain America sprite sheet (48x64px frames)

## Note

To create or find suitable assets, consider:
1. Using pixel art tools like Aseprite, Piskel, or PyxelEdit
2. Finding open-source game assets on sites like OpenGameArt.org or itch.io
3. Creating custom assets that match the RPG style shown in the reference image
4. Ensuring all assets are properly licensed for your use
